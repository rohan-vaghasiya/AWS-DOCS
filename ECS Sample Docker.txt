Q1. Creating a sample Docker application on ECS


	1. Search and Go to Elastic container service (ECS)
	
	2. Get started (or click on clusters) 
	-> Create Cluster 
	-> give name 
	-> Click on Create, Wait ……… till cluster creation process completed.
	
	3. Go to Task Definition (from side panel) 
	-> choose Create New Task Definition with JSON (from create new task definition button dropdown) 
	-> Replace below JSON with default one 
	-> and Click on Create.
Replace below given JSON:
{
    "family": "sample-fargate", 
    "networkMode": "awsvpc", 
    "containerDefinitions": [
        {
            "name": "fargate-app", 
            "image": "public.ecr.aws/docker/library/httpd:latest", 
            "portMappings": [
                {
                    "containerPort": 80, 
                    "hostPort": 80, 
                    "protocol": "tcp"
                }
            ], 
            "essential": true, 
            "entryPoint": [
                "sh",
		"-c"
            ], 
            "command": [
                "/bin/sh -c \"echo '<html> <head> <title>Amazon ECS Sample App</title> <style>body {margin-top: 40px; background-color: #333;} </style> </head><body> <div style=color:white;text-align:center> <h1>Amazon ECS Sample App</h1> <h2>Congratulations!</h2> <p>Your application is now running on a container in Amazon ECS.</p> </div></body></html>' >  /usr/local/apache2/htdocs/index.html && httpd-foreground\""
            ]
        }
    ], 
    "requiresCompatibilities": [
        "FARGATE"
    ], 
    "cpu": "256", 
    "memory": "512"
}

	4. Now you will be redirected to one slide from there, Choose Create Service (from Deploy Button dropdown) 
	-> choose existing cluster (which created) 
	-> scroll down and enter unique Service Name (eg: dockerservice23) 
	-> Click on Create  
	-> in blue panel you can see view CloudFormation (if your service deploy fail not to be worry click on retry button in cloud formation). Wait till service deployed completely.

	5. Go to clusters (from side panel) 
	-> click on that created cluster to open
	-> scroll down 
	-> select Tasks tab 
	-> click on running task from list (to go to inside) 
	-> In Configuration tab there is Public IP copy that and Paste in browser (It will not work due to security issue)
	-> click on Networking tab -> click on Security Groups (which is selected by default) -> on that add new inbound rule http, anywhere-> copy Public IP -> paste on new tab 
	
	6. Now check that copied public IP will run!!!!!!!!!!!
