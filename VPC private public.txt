VPC : 
	-->connect your EC2 instance with public VPC

	  => VPC Creation:
		-> go to vpc - create VPC
		-> select VPC and more
		-> rest all things keep same and create VPC
		
	 =>  Create Public EC2:
		-> go to EC2 instance and refresh page (TO refresh Security groups)
		-> Create instance, give Ec2 instance name.
		-> select .ppk key pair
		-> edit n/w settings - select created VPC -> Choose public subnet of created VPC.
		-> enable auto assign ip
		-> in public instance -> security -> add inbound rule All trafic from anywhere.
	
	 =>  Create Private EC2:
		-> now create same second EC2 instance (private Ec2 instance) and select subnet as private subnet of created VPC while creation , rest all things are same as public instance with add inbound rule All trafic from anywhere.
		
		
	 =>  To connect private ec2 IP into public ec2:
		-> connect public ec2 into putty.
		-> give Commands, 
		-> sudo su 
		-> yum install vim 
		-> vim keypair.pem 
		-> it will open vim editor, now convert .ppk(which you have used while instance creation) to .pem file and copy .pem file content and paste it here and press :wq
		-> chmod 600 keypair.pem
		-> ssh -i keypair.pem ec2-user@private_ec2_ip
			(replace private_ec2_ip with Your private instace private IP)
		-> now Private it's connected


	Now For Testing,
	    For Public EC2 ping Test: Copy public IP -> Open CMD -> ping TYPE_PUBLIC_IP_OF_PUBLIC_EC2
	    For Private Ec2 ping Test: Copy private IP of Private EC2 -> Open public EC2 server terminal from Putty or SSH -> ping TYPE_PRIVATE_IP_OF_PRIVATE_EC2
